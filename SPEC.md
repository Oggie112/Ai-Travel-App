# Travel Planning App: Budget Adventure Holidays

## 1. Overview
This is a travel planning app designed for **budget-conscious backpackers, solo travelers, and couples** seeking adventure-based holidays. The app will help users **discover adventure activities** across different destinations while providing **cost information**. The goal is to help users **explore, refine, and decide** on exciting travel options through a simple, visual, and engaging interface.

## 2. Core Features
- **Random Activity Discovery**: Show users a list of 5 random adventure activities and destinations, with minimal text and emphasis on high-quality images.
- **Filtering Options**: Users can refine options based on:
  - **Activity type** (e.g., hiking, surfing, culture, etc.)
  - **Distance** (e.g., flight time from user’s location)
  - **Cost** (estimated price ranges for each activity)
  - **Destination** (specific country or region)
- **Favorites System**: Users can save 2 favorite trips at a time. If they choose a new favorite, they must replace one of the existing ones.
- **Refinement and Exploration**: Users refine their options based on the above filters until they narrow it down to two final choices.
- **Inspiration-First Design**: The app should present the user with visually rich, image-based recommendations first, with minimal text.
- **Cost Estimation and Booking Guidance**: Provide general cost information and suggest external sites where users can book the activities.

## 3. User Interface (UI) and Design
- **Landing Screen**: 
  - Display 5 random activity-destination pairs.
  - Show a large, attractive image of the activity or destination.
  - Display activity name, type (e.g., surfing, hiking), and basic location.
  - Hide detailed text until the user clicks to explore further.
- **Activity/Trip Details**: 
  - Once a user clicks an option, show detailed information such as estimated cost, activity description, and logistical details.
  - Allow users to refine the results using filters for activity type, destination, and cost.
  - Users can **favorite** up to 2 trips for comparison.
- **Minimalistic Aesthetic**: Use a clean, neutral design with occasional subtle color accents to keep the focus on the images. Text and UI elements should be unobtrusive and not overwhelm the user.

## 4. Architecture Suggestions
- **Frontend (Mobile App)**: 
  - **Frameworks**: React Native (for cross-platform development) or Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) for native apps.
  - **UI Components**: Utilize image carousels, modals for detailed information, and simple filter menus.
  - **Data Handling**: 
    - Data from external APIs (deals, destinations, activities) will be aggregated and presented to the user.
    - User preferences and favorites will be stored locally using device storage (e.g., AsyncStorage for React Native or CoreData for iOS).
  
- **Backend (Server-side)**: 
  - **API Endpoints**: 
    - `/getRandomActivities`: Returns a list of random activities and destinations (aggregated from multiple providers).
    - `/getFilteredActivities`: Allows filtering based on activity type, destination, budget, and flight time.
    - `/getActivityDetails`: Provides detailed information about a specific activity.
  - **Technologies**: Node.js with Express.js (for API), PostgreSQL for storing activity data (or an external database if data comes from third-party sources).
  
- **External Data Sources**: 
  - Use third-party APIs (e.g., Skyscanner, Hostelworld, Viator, etc.) to gather information on activities, costs, and accommodations. 
  - Fetch random activities from multiple sources to provide variety.

## 5. Data Handling
- **User Data**: 
  - User preferences and favorites are saved locally.
  - No sensitive personal data (e.g., credit card info) will be stored. 
  - Users’ location (for flight time and destination) is handled through permissions.
- **Activity Data**: 
  - Activities are retrieved from external APIs, ensuring **real-time updates** on availability, prices, and descriptions.
  - Ensure all fetched data is formatted consistently before displaying.
  
- **Local Storage**: 
  - User favorites (2 max) and selected filters (destination, budget range) are saved locally.
  - Use local storage for non-sensitive user preferences.

## 6. Error Handling
- **API Failures**: 
  - Show a user-friendly message in case the app fails to fetch activity or deal information (e.g., "Oops, something went wrong. Please try again later.").
  - Retry API requests if a failure occurs due to a network error.
  
- **Invalid Data**: 
  - Handle cases where no data is returned by a third-party API (e.g., no random activities found for a particular destination).
  - Show a message like "No activities found for this destination, try another one!".
  
- **Favorites Limit**: 
  - If the user tries to add more than 2 favorites, prompt them with a message to remove one of the existing ones (e.g., "You can only save 2 favorites. Please remove one to continue.").

- **Refinement Logic**: 
  - If no options match the selected filters (e.g., if no activities match the user’s budget or location preferences), show a message like "No results match your filters. Try adjusting them."

## 7. Testing Plan
- **Unit Testing**: 
  - Test all core functions individually, such as random activity generation, filtering by budget, and favoriting.
  
- **Integration Testing**: 
  - Ensure that the API calls work correctly and return data in the expected format.
  - Test the seamless flow of user actions (e.g., refining options, selecting favorites).

- **UI/UX Testing**: 
  - Validate the overall user experience—ensure the app is intuitive, and users can easily discover, refine, and save their favorite activities.
  - Test for responsiveness on various screen sizes.
  
- **Performance Testing**: 
  - Test the app’s speed, particularly when loading images or refreshing the list of activities.
  - Ensure smooth transitions between screens, especially during the refinement process.

- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
  - Conduct usability testing with a small group of target users to identify any friction points.
  - Gather feedback on the app’s visual design, filtering system, and overall flow.

## 8. Deployment and Maintenance
- **Deployment**: 
  - Deploy the backend to a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
  - Push the mobile app to the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android).

- **Post-Launch Maintenance**: 
  - Regularly update external APIs to ensure up-to-date information on activities and deals.
  - Monitor app performance and crash analytics to handle any emerging issues.
